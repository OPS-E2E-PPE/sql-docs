# Test on macOS

For the macOS platform, you can install the `azdata-cli` with Homebrew package manager. The CLI package has been tested on macOS versions:

- 10.13 High Sierra
- 10.14 Mojave
- 10.15 Catalina

## Install with Homebrew

```bash
brew tap microsoft/azdata-cli-release
brew update
brew install azdata-cli
```

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The `azdata-cli` has a dependency on the Homebrew `python3`, `freetds`, `unixodbc`, `zeromq` packages, and will install them. The `azdata-cli` is guaranteed to be compatible with the latest version of these dependencies published on Homebrew.

## Verify install

```bash
azdata
azdata --version
```

## Update

Update your local repository information and then upgrade the `azdata-cli` package.

```bash
brew tap microsoft/azdata-cli-release
brew update
brew upgrade azdata-cli
```

## Uninstall

Use Homebrew to uninstall the `azdata-cli` package.

```bash
brew uninstall azdata-cli
```
